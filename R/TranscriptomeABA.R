#' Abscisic acid stress microarray dataset in *Arabidopsis thaliana*
#'
#' This is a gene expression matrix for Arabidopsis under ABA stress conditions.
#' The first column is the gene ID column, all others are sample ID columns.
#' The expression data are read as raw data (CEL files) and summarized and normalized by Robust Multi-array Average (RMA).
#' To keep the file size small, the data is limited to 1,000 genes.
