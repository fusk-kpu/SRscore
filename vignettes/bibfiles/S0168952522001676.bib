abstract = {The increasing availability of high-throughput datasets allows amalgamating research information across a large body of genome regulation studies. Given the recent success of meta-analyses on transcriptional regulators, epigenetic marks, and enhancer:gene associations, we expect that such surveys will continue to provide novel and reproducible insights. However, meta-analyses are severely hampered by the diversity of available data, concurring protocols, an eclectic amount of bioinformatics tools, and myriads of conceivable parameter combinations. Such factors can easily bar life scientists from synthesizing omics data and substantially curb their interpretability. Despite statistical challenges of the method, we would like to emphasize the advantages of joining data from different sources through vote-counting and showcase examples that achieve a simple but highly intuitive data integration.}
