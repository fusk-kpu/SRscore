# Introduction
Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine data from multiple studies on similar hypotheses and is widely applied in genomic research [@10.1093/nar/gkr1265]. For example, meta-analyses have been used to identify genes that respond to specific stress conditions, revealing both common and unique genes affected by multiple stresses rather than just a single stress. Various meta-analyses, particularly those using transcriptome data, have been conducted to search for and predict the functions of stress-responsive genes [@life12071079 ; @10.3389/fpls.2024.1343787]. As reported in a previous study [@life12071079], we computed Stress Response score (SRscore) using a modified version of the vote-counting method [@10.1093/nar/gkr1265] for each stress condition. The difference from the HN-ratio and HN-score in Tamura and Bono (2022) is whether or not fold-change calculations are performed on all pairs of combinations of the treatment and control groups [@10.1093/plphys/kiaf105].

The development of the **SRscore** package was born out of the need to simplify and standardize the meta-analysis of gene expression data across multiple research projects. As the value of using historical data increases, researchers in the field of transcriptomics are increasingly dealing with complex data sets containing a wide variety of control and processing conditions applied to different biological samples and experimental designs. This diversity can make it difficult to consistently compare the effects of treatments on gene expression across studies.

Traditionally, these comparisons have been carried out using ad-hoc scripts or custom workflows, which can be error-prone and difficult to reproduce. Furthermore, with increasing research projects and datasets, it is clear that there was a need for an efficient and automated method.

**SRscore** package was developed to address these issues. It introduces a streamlined and reproducible workflow for generating control-treatment comparisons, calculating gene expression ratios, and scoring gene regulation patterns.

The package simplifies analysis, enhances reproducibility, and helps researchers focus on interpreting the biological significance of their results, rather than spending time on data wrangling or manual calculations. The basic functions of the **SRscore** package can be applied not only to transcriptome data but also to metabolome data.

This vignette provides a practical explanation of how to calculate SR scores and gives examples of the data and visualizations needed to do so.

# Sample Data

Metadata and gene expression matrices are required to calculate SRscore. The following are sample data built into the **SRscore** package and can be called from `data()`. These data are used in [Example Workflow](#ew). The demonstration data include six GEO series examining *Arabidopsis thaliana* under ABA treatment conditions, corresponding to the accession numbers [GSE6638](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6638), 
[GSE7112](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7112), 
[GSE19520](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19520), 
[GSE28800](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE28800), 
[GSE39384](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39384), and [GSE135489](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135489). The demo datasets are a practical resource for users to gain a basic understanding of the SRscore analysis workflow.

## MetadataABA

In transcriptome analysis, a file called metadata, which describes information about the experimental data set, such as sample IDs and conditions, is important.
`MetadataABA` is the metadata for the experimental dataset related to *A. thaliana* under ABA stress conditions. Metadata are used to define pairs for comparison between the target sample group and the experimental sample group. The information required here is, for example, the identification ID of each experimental data set, control sample, and experimental sample used in a database such as NCBI GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/); other information is optional.

About columns：

- Series: Identification ID of the experimental data set
- control_sample: Identification ID of control sample
- treated_sample: Identification ID of treated sample
- treatment: Treatment condition (optional)
- tissue: Name of tissue (optional)
```{r}
library(tibble)
data("MetadataABA")
tibble(MetadataABA)
```

## TranscriptomeABA
This is a gene expression matrix for *Arabidopsis thaliana* under ABA stress conditions. The first column is the gene ID column, all others are sample ID columns. The expression data are read as raw data (CEL files) and summarized and normalized by Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) [@Irizarry2003-uj]. To keep the file size small, the data is limited to 1,000 genes.
```{r}
data("TranscriptomeABA")
tibble(TranscriptomeABA)
```

## SRGA (Stress Responsive Gene Atlas)
This data were generated by integrating SRscores calculated separately from experimental datasets under 11 different stress conditions [@10.1093/plphys/kiaf105]. Because the SRscore scale varied across conditions, the values were standardized using z-scores. In subsequent [Template Matching](#tm) [@Pavlidis2001-ie], genes with similar SRscore patterns under different stress conditions were searched based on SRGA.

```{r}
data("SRGA")
tibble(SRGA)
```

# Example Workflow
Here is a workflow with [Sample Data](#sd).

## 1. Comparison pairs
As the first step, `expand_by_group()` is used to generate all possible combinations between the two groups (control and treatment) within each research project. Note that the `var1` argument should be assigned to the control group and `var2` to the treatment group.
```{r}
grp <- "Series"
var1 <- "control_sample"
var2 <- "treated_sample"

ebg <- expand_by_group(.data = MetadataABA, 
                       grp = grp,
                       var1 = var1,
                       var2 = var2)

# View the unique research projects
unique_series <- unique(MetadataABA$Series)
unique_series

# Subset the expanded data for each research project
lapply(unique_series, function(x) subset(ebg, Series == x))
```

In this example, `expand_by_group()` takes a data frame (MetadataABA) and generates combinations of control and treatment samples for each research project (Series).

## 2. SRratio
Next, we use `calcSRratio()` to calculate SRratio. SRratio is the gene expression ratio calculated over different research projects, based on all combinations between target and experimental samples obtained in each. Assign the result of `expand_by_group()` to the argument `pair`. The argument `is.log` should be set to TRUE if the data has already been log-transformed; otherwise, set it to FALSE to apply log transformation automatically.

```{r}
SRratio <- calcSRratio(.data = TranscriptomeABA, 
                       var1 = var1,
                       var2 = var2, 
                       pair = ebg, 
                       is.log = TRUE)

# Preview the SRratio data frame
tibble(SRratio)
```

In this example, calcSRratio() calculates the gene expression ratios for control and treated samples based on the input data frame (TranscriptomeABA).

It is also possible to calculate SRratio directly without using expand_by_group(). This calculation method was used in [@life12071079].
```{r}
conventional_SRratio <- calcSRratio(TranscriptomeABA,
                                    var1 = var1,
                                    var2 = var2,
                                    pair = MetadataABA, 
                                    is.log = TRUE)
# Preview the SRratio data frame
tibble(conventional_SRratio)
```

## 3. SRscore
Finally, we calculate the SRscore, a metric summarizing gene expression changes across conditions and projects. The calcSRscore() function takes the SRratio data frame and calculates the SRscore, which reflects how many times the gene was significantly up- or down-regulated over the entire experiment. The threshold is set by default to judge SRratrio greater than 2 as up-regulated and SRratio less than -2 as down-regulated, but can be changed to a number of your choice.

```{r}
SRscore <- calcSRscore(SRratio, threshold = c(-2, 2))

# Preview the SRscore results
tibble(SRscore)
```

caluculate_SRscore() can be used for just a numerical matrix, and is expected to be used in all situations, not just this example.
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
mt <- data.frame(X0 = runif(100) * 3, 
                 X1 = runif(100) * 3, 
                 X2 = runif(100) * 3, 
                 X3 = runif(100) * 3, 
                 X4 = runif(100) * 3)
smt <- calcSRscore(mt)
tibble(smt)
```

## All in one

We have introduced the three functions in order to calculate SRscore. `directly_calcSRscore()` executes these functions together and stress the result of each in a list.
```{r}
res <- directly_calcSRscore(.data1 = MetadataABA,
                            grp = grp,
                            var1 = var1,
                            var2 = var2,
                            .data2 = TranscriptomeABA,
                            is.log = TRUE)
names(res)
tibble(res$SRscore)
```


# Visualization
SRscore can be used for a variety of evaluations. The following are examples.

## Examine the expression pattern of each experimental sample for the specified gene.
`find_diffexp()` can extract the SRratio and metadata of the genes of interest. This will tell you which experimental samples showed what kind of expression pattern of the specified genes.
In the following, <a href = https://bar.utoronto.ca/thalemine/keywordSearchResults.do?searchTerm=AT1G10230 > AT1G10230 </a> was specified as an example.
```{r}
set.seed(1)
res <- find_diffexp(sample(SRratio$ensembl_gene_id, 1),
                    SRratio,
                    SRscore,
                    MetadataABA)
tibble(res$result)
tibble(res$SRscore)
```

In the following, 10 random genes were specified.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
res2 <- find_diffexp(sample(SRratio$ensembl_gene_id, 10), 
                     SRratio,
                     SRscore,
                     MetadataABA)

tibble(res2$result)

tibble(res2$SRscore)
```

If multiple genes are specified, a heat map is more likely to provide useful information.The <a href = https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html > ComplexHeatmap </a> package [@Gu2016-ez] can be used to create parallel heatmaps with annotation graphics.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(RColorBrewer)

cor_breaks <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 51)
cor_color <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(51)

annotation_row <- res2$result[, c("treatment", "tissue")]
treatment_names <- unique(annotation_row$treatment)
tissue_names <- unique(annotation_row$tissue)

pal_treatment <- brewer.pal(length(treatment_names),"Set1")
pal_tissue <- brewer.pal(length(tissue_names), "Set2")

names(pal_treatment) <- treatment_names
names(pal_tissue) <- tissue_names

pheatmap(as.matrix(Filter(is.numeric, res2$result)),
         breaks = cor_breaks,
         color = cor_color,
         annotation_row = annotation_row,
         annotation_colors = list(treatment = pal_treatment,
                                  tissue = pal_tissue),
         cluster_rows = FALSE,
         name = "SRratio")
```

## Performing enrichment analysis using SRscore
The SRscore deviates further from 0 as the gene’s expression consistently shifts in one direction across multiple studies.
Therefore, it's important to identify what biological functions or pathways are associated with gene sets extracted based on SRscore. This can be done through enrichment analysis using the <a href = https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html > clusterProfiler </a> package [@Yu2012-si]. The following example performs Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for genes with SRscore ≥ 1.

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(clusterProfiler)

ego <- enrichGO(SRscore$ensembl_gene_id[which(SRscore$score >= 1)],
                OrgDb = "org.At.tair.db",
                keyType = "TAIR",
                ont = "BP",
                maxGSSize = 2000
                )

dotplot(ego)
```

## Template matching
By applying the Template Matching [@Pavlidis2001-ie] , other genes with similar patterns can be found based on the SRscore pattern (template) that a gene has. The similarity between genes is calculated based on the specified calculation method and sorted in decreasing order. Here, the 5 genes with the most similar SRscore patterns are extracted from the 1000 genes in the sample data `SRGA`, using *Gols3*, one of the low temperature stress response genes, as an example.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(genefilter)
library(DT)

# Data Processing
## Retrieve the name of the column that has SRscore as an element.
cl <- colnames(Filter(is.numeric, SRGA))
## Move gene IDs to row names.
df <- column_to_rownames(SRGA, var = "ensembl_gene_id")
## Converting from dataframe to matrix.
df <- as.matrix(df[cl])

# Template specification (in this case Gols3)
template <- "AT1G09350"

# Perform template matching
close_genes <- genefinder(df,
                          ilist = template,
                          numResults = 5,
                          method = "euclidean"
                          )

# SRscore pattern for templates
datatable(SRGA[which(SRGA$ensembl_gene_id == template), ],
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-nowrap', targets = "_all")),
                         dom = "lrtBip"),
          rownames = FALSE
          )

# Matching results
datatable(add_column(SRGA[close_genes[[1]]$indices, ], 
                     "dists" = round(close_genes[[1]]$dists, digits = 3),
                     .after = max(which(sapply(SRGA, is.numeric)))),
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-nowrap', targets = "_all")),
                         dom = "lrtBip"),
          rownames = FALSE
      )
```

# Summary of Outputs
The **SRscore** package provides several key outputs that streamline transcriptomic meta-analysis:

**Comparison pairs:** Lists all control–treatment sample pairs defined within each experimental series, providing the foundation for consistent comparisons across studies.

**SRratio:** Contains gene-wise expression ratios computed for each comparison pair, enabling the evaluation of expression changes under specific treatment conditions.

**SRscore:** Summarizes the overall expression trends for each gene by counting the frequency of up- or down-regulation across all comparisons. Genes with consistently altered expression are highlighted by higher absolute scores.

Together, these outputs offer a reproducible and scalable framework for identifying stress-responsive genes across diverse experimental datasets. By automating complex steps and standardizing analysis, the **SRscore** package allows researchers to extract meaningful biological insights more efficiently.

The following figure illustrates the process of deriving the SRscore.
![The process of deriving SRscore](Derivation_process_of_SRscore.png)
Figure 1. **Detailed calculation of SRscores.** We identified stress-responsive genes using the Stress Responsive (SR) score, which is shown here [@10.1093/plphys/kiaf105]. Essentially, it is based on the fold change (FC) in gene expression between the two groups, a modification of the approach reported in [@life12071079]. The difference from the HN-ratio and HN-score in [@life12071079] is whether or not FC calculations are performed on all pairs of combinations of the treatment and control groups. In Step (1), FC is calculated for all pairs of combinations of the treatment and control groups within a project/dataset and their mean value is obtained, which is called SRratio. This procedure is intended to reduce batch effects, which means systematic nonbiological variations that arise from differences in the experimental conditions across different batches of samples. Please note that we used log2FC for both platforms. In Step (2), the FC value is considered to be upregulation (“U”)/downregulation (“D”) at a certain threshold; here, |SRratio| ≥2 and those with no change in magnification near zero are considered to be not changed (a high SRscore can be interpreted as a tendency toward consistent upregulation in many research projects, whereas a low SRscore indicates a tendency toward consistent downregulation). N). In Step (3), the total number of “U” or “D” labels calculated in this manner is subtracted to obtain the SRscore. Roughly, it is a modification of the vote-counting system [@10.1093/nar/gkr1265]. Finally, we obtained Z-scored SRscores for further analysis and construction of the [AtSRGA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fusk-kpu/AtSRGA).
