ABSTRACT = {Hypoxia is an abiotic stress in plants. Flooding resulting from climate change is a major crop threat that increases the risk of hypoxic stress. The molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia in plants were elucidated in recent years, but new genes related to this stress remain to be discovered. Thus, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) under hypoxia. We collected 29 (Arabidopsis) and 26 (rice) pairs of RNA-Seq data involving hypoxic (including submergence) and normoxic (control) treatments and extracted the genes that were commonly upregulated or downregulated in the majority of the experiments. The meta-analysis revealed 40 and 19 commonly upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in the two species. Several WRKY transcription factors and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase were commonly upregulated, but their involvement in hypoxia remains unclear. Our meta-analysis identified candidate genes for novel molecular mechanisms in plants under hypoxia.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold negatively affect plant growth and crop productivity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to these stressors is essential for stress tolerance in crops. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is significantly increased upon abiotic stressors, inducing physiological responses to adapt to stress and regulate gene expression. Although many studies have examined the components of established stress signaling pathways, few have explored other unknown elements. This study aimed to identify novel stress-responsive genes in plants by performing a meta-analysis of public RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, focusing on five ABA-related stress conditions (ABA, Salt, Dehydration, Osmotic, and Cold). The meta-analysis of 216 paired datasets from five stress conditions was conducted, and differentially expressed genes were identified by introducing a new metric, called TN [stress-treated (T) and non-treated (N)] score. We revealed that 14 genes were commonly upregulated and 8 genes were commonly downregulated across all five treatments, including some that were not previously associated with these stress responses. On the other hand, some genes regulated by salt, dehydration, and osmotic treatments were not regulated by exogenous ABA or cold stress, suggesting that they may be involved in the plant response to dehydration independent of ABA. Our meta-analysis revealed a list of candidate genes with unknown molecular mechanisms in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent stress responses. These genes could be valuable resources for selecting genome editing targets and potentially contribute to the discovery of novel stress tolerance mechanisms and pathways in plants.</p>}}

  title    = "Analysis of strain and regional variation in gene expression in
              mouse brain",
  author   = "Pavlidis, P and Noble, W S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We performed a statistical analysis of a previously
              published set of gene expression microarray data from six
              different brain regions in two mouse strains. In the previous
              analysis, 24 genes showing expression differences between the
              strains and about 240 genes with regional differences in
              expression were identified. Like many gene expression studies,
              that analysis relied primarily on ad hoc 'fold change' and
              'absent/present' criteria to select genes. To determine whether
              statistically motivated methods would give a more sensitive and
              selective analysis of gene expression patterns in the brain, we
              decided to use analysis of variance (ANOVA) and feature selection
              methods designed to select genes showing strain- or
              region-dependent patterns of expression. RESULTS: Our analysis
              revealed many additional genes that might be involved in
              behavioral differences between the two mouse strains and
              functional differences between the six brain regions. Using
              conservative statistical criteria, we identified at least 63
              genes showing strain variation and approximately 600 genes
              showing regional variation. Unlike ad hoc methods, ours have the
              additional benefit of ranking the genes by statistical score,
              permitting further analysis to focus on the most significant.
              Comparison of our results to the previous studies and to
              published reports on individual genes show that we achieved high
              sensitivity while preserving selectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results indicate that molecular differences between the strains
              and regions studied are larger than indicated previously. We
              conclude that for large complex datasets, ANOVA and feature
              selection, alone or in combination, are more powerful than
              methods based on fold-change thresholds and other ad hoc
              selection criteria.",

               GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in

               dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
               GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the
               perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these
               data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with
               probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so
               delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the
               arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then
               examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and
               assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i)
               average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
               the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index

               ability to detect known levels of differential expression using
               the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside

While numerous genome-wide studies of TP53 and CC-regulated genes have been performed, significant variation between studies has made it difficult to assess regulation of any given gene of interest. To overcome the limitation of individual studies, we developed a meta-analysis approach to identify high confidence target genes that reflect their frequency of identification in independent datasets. Gene regulatory networks were generated by comparing differential expression of TP53 and CC-regulated genes with chromatin immunoprecipitation studies for TP53, RB1, E2F, DREAM, B-MYB, FOXM1 and MuvB. RNA-seq data from p21-null cells revealed that gene downregulation by TP53 generally requires p21 (CDKN1A). Genes downregulated by TP53 were also identified as CC genes bound by the DREAM complex. The transcription factors RB, E2F1 and E2F7 bind to a subset of DREAM target genes that function in G1/S of the CC while B-MYB, FOXM1 and MuvB control G2/M gene expression. Our approach yields high confidence ranked target gene maps for TP53, DREAM, MMB-FOXM1 and RB-E2F and enables prediction and distinction of CC regulation.

The application was developed using 1,131 microarrays and 1,050 RNA sequencing datasets obtained from public databases. These datasets correspond to 11 stress-related conditions, namely abscisic acid, cold, drought, heat, high-light, hypoxia, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salt, wounding, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Using a modified meta-analysis technique known as the vote-counting method, we computed integrated scores to evaluate stress responsiveness for each condition across multiple studies. AtSRGA visualizes gene behavior under 11 stress conditions and offers an interactive, user-friendly interface accessible to all researchers. It presents a comprehensive heatmap of stress-responsive genes, facilitating the comparative analysis of individual stress responses and groups of genes responding to multiple stresses. We validated the expression patterns of several high-scoring genes of unknown function under cold and heat stress using RT-qPCR, thus demonstrating that our application helps select targets to understand stress-responsive gene networks in Arabidopsis.

ABSTRACT = {Hypoxia is a condition in which cells, tissues, or organisms are deprived of sufficient oxygen supply. Aerobic organisms have a hypoxic response system, represented by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1A), to adapt to this condition. Due to publication bias, there has been little focus on genes other than well-known signature hypoxia-inducible genes. Therefore, in this study, we performed a meta-analysis to identify novel hypoxia-inducible genes. We searched publicly available transcriptome databases to obtain hypoxia-related experimental data, retrieved the metadata, and manually curated it. We selected the genes that are differentially expressed by hypoxic stimulation, and evaluated their relevance in hypoxia by performing enrichment analyses. Next, we performed a bibliometric analysis using gene2pubmed data to examine genes that have not been well studied in relation to hypoxia. Gene2pubmed data provides information about the relationship between genes and publications. We calculated and evaluated the number of reports and similarity coefficients of each gene to HIF1A, which is a representative gene in hypoxia studies. In this data-driven study, we report that several genes that were not known to be associated with hypoxia, including the G protein-coupled receptor 146 gene, are upregulated by hypoxic stimulation.},
