    abstract = {With the rapid advances of various high-throughput technologies, generation of ‘-omics’ data is commonplace in almost every biomedical field. Effective data management and analytical approaches are essential to fully decipher the biological knowledge contained in the tremendous amount of experimental data. Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining multiple studies of a related hypothesis, has become popular in genomic research. Here, we perform a systematic search from PubMed and manual collection to obtain 620 genomic meta-analysis papers, of which 333 microarray meta-analysis papers are summarized as the basis of this paper and the other 249 GWAS meta-analysis papers are discussed in the next companion paper. The review in the present paper focuses on various biological purposes of microarray meta-analysis, databases and software and related statistical procedures. Statistical considerations of such an analysis are further scrutinized and illustrated by a case study. Finally, several open questions are listed and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Hypoxia is an abiotic stress in plants. Flooding resulting from climate change is a major crop threat that increases the risk of hypoxic stress. The molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia in plants were elucidated in recent years, but new genes related to this stress remain to be discovered. Thus, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) under hypoxia. We collected 29 (Arabidopsis) and 26 (rice) pairs of RNA-Seq data involving hypoxic (including submergence) and normoxic (control) treatments and extracted the genes that were commonly upregulated or downregulated in the majority of the experiments. The meta-analysis revealed 40 and 19 commonly upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in the two species. Several WRKY transcription factors and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase were commonly upregulated, but their involvement in hypoxia remains unclear. Our meta-analysis identified candidate genes for novel molecular mechanisms in plants under hypoxia.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold negatively affect plant growth and crop productivity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to these stressors is essential for stress tolerance in crops. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is significantly increased upon abiotic stressors, inducing physiological responses to adapt to stress and regulate gene expression. Although many studies have examined the components of established stress signaling pathways, few have explored other unknown elements. This study aimed to identify novel stress-responsive genes in plants by performing a meta-analysis of public RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, focusing on five ABA-related stress conditions (ABA, Salt, Dehydration, Osmotic, and Cold). The meta-analysis of 216 paired datasets from five stress conditions was conducted, and differentially expressed genes were identified by introducing a new metric, called TN [stress-treated (T) and non-treated (N)] score. We revealed that 14 genes were commonly upregulated and 8 genes were commonly downregulated across all five treatments, including some that were not previously associated with these stress responses. On the other hand, some genes regulated by salt, dehydration, and osmotic treatments were not regulated by exogenous ABA or cold stress, suggesting that they may be involved in the plant response to dehydration independent of ABA. Our meta-analysis revealed a list of candidate genes with unknown molecular mechanisms in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent stress responses. These genes could be valuable resources for selecting genome editing targets and potentially contribute to the discovery of novel stress tolerance mechanisms and pathways in plants.</p>}}

  title    = "Analysis of strain and regional variation in gene expression in
              mouse brain",
  author   = "Pavlidis, P and Noble, W S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We performed a statistical analysis of a previously
              published set of gene expression microarray data from six
              different brain regions in two mouse strains. In the previous
              analysis, 24 genes showing expression differences between the
              strains and about 240 genes with regional differences in
              expression were identified. Like many gene expression studies,
              that analysis relied primarily on ad hoc 'fold change' and
              'absent/present' criteria to select genes. To determine whether
              statistically motivated methods would give a more sensitive and
              selective analysis of gene expression patterns in the brain, we
              decided to use analysis of variance (ANOVA) and feature selection
              methods designed to select genes showing strain- or
              region-dependent patterns of expression. RESULTS: Our analysis
              revealed many additional genes that might be involved in
              behavioral differences between the two mouse strains and
              functional differences between the six brain regions. Using
              conservative statistical criteria, we identified at least 63
              genes showing strain variation and approximately 600 genes
              showing regional variation. Unlike ad hoc methods, ours have the
              additional benefit of ranking the genes by statistical score,
              permitting further analysis to focus on the most significant.
              Comparison of our results to the previous studies and to
              published reports on individual genes show that we achieved high
              sensitivity while preserving selectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results indicate that molecular differences between the strains
              and regions studied are larger than indicated previously. We
              conclude that for large complex datasets, ANOVA and feature
              selection, alone or in combination, are more powerful than
              methods based on fold-change thresholds and other ad hoc
              selection criteria.",

               with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of
               gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a
               small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse
               GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in
               study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute
               involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a
               dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
               GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the
               perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these
               data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with
               probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so
               delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the
               arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then
               examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and
               assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i)
               average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
               the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index
               (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data
               motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array
               average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and
               log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression
               summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their
               behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model
               fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their
               ability to detect known levels of differential expression using
               the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside
               to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this
               quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific
               affinities.",
