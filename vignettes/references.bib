  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We performed a statistical analysis of a previously
              published set of gene expression microarray data from six
              different brain regions in two mouse strains. In the previous
              analysis, 24 genes showing expression differences between the
              strains and about 240 genes with regional differences in
              expression were identified. Like many gene expression studies,
              that analysis relied primarily on ad hoc 'fold change' and
              'absent/present' criteria to select genes. To determine whether
              statistically motivated methods would give a more sensitive and
              selective analysis of gene expression patterns in the brain, we
              decided to use analysis of variance (ANOVA) and feature selection
              methods designed to select genes showing strain- or
              region-dependent patterns of expression. RESULTS: Our analysis
              revealed many additional genes that might be involved in
              behavioral differences between the two mouse strains and
              functional differences between the six brain regions. Using
              conservative statistical criteria, we identified at least 63
              genes showing strain variation and approximately 600 genes
              showing regional variation. Unlike ad hoc methods, ours have the
              additional benefit of ranking the genes by statistical score,
              permitting further analysis to focus on the most significant.
              Comparison of our results to the previous studies and to
              published reports on individual genes show that we achieved high
              sensitivity while preserving selectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results indicate that molecular differences between the strains
              and regions studied are larger than indicated previously. We
              conclude that for large complex datasets, ANOVA and feature
              selection, alone or in combination, are more powerful than
              methods based on fold-change thresholds and other ad hoc
              selection criteria.",
