Description: Stress Response score (SRscore) is a stress responsiveness 
    measure for transcriptome datasets and is based on the vote-counting 
    method. The SRscore is determined to evaluate and scores genes on the 
    basis of the consistency of the direction of their regulation 
    (Up-regulation, Down-regulation, or No changed) under stress conditions 
    across the analyzed, multiple research projects. This package is based on 
    the HN-score of Tamura and Bono (2022), and can calculate both 
    the original method and the calculation method we have extended 
    (Fukuda et al. 2025).
