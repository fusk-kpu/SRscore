Description: Stress Response score (SRscore) is a stress responsiveness 
    measure for transcriptome datasets and is based on the vote-counting 
    method. The SRscore is determined to evaluate and score genes on the 
    basis of the consistency of the direction of their regulation 
    (Up-regulation, Down-regulation, or No change) under stress conditions 
    across multiple analyzed research projects. This package is based on 
    the HN-score (score based on the ratio of gene expression between
    hypoxic and normoxic conditions) proposed by 
    Tamura and Bono (2022) <doi:10.3390/life12071079>, and can calculate both 
    the original method and an extended calculation method described in 
    Fukuda et al. (2025) <doi:10.1093/plphys/kiaf105>.
